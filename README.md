Dr. Gourd's CSC 450 course
This course emphasizes a hands-on approach to practical learning in computer hardware security. Students will engage in a series of well-crafted experiments using a dedicated hardware platform known as HaHa. Through these experiments, participants will gain insights into the inner workings of computer systems, exploring security vulnerabilities, ethical hacking, and implementing countermeasures to safeguard hardware.

The HaHa board, a custom-designed hardware platform, serves as an experimental development board for comprehensive teaching and learning in various aspects of hardware security. It supports over a dozen experiments that cover essential hardware security fundamentals, diverse attack types, and countermeasures. These attacks encompass reverse engineering, counterfeiting/cloning, side-channel, fault injection, and physical tampering (e.g., hardware Trojan, mod-chip).

Developed by Prof. Swarup Bhunia in collaboration with students and partners at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Florida, the HaHa board facilitates hands-on exploration of hardware security concepts. The course, offered annually for the past five years, includes 19 experiments (including Experiment 0) tailored for the HaHa board.

The unique aspect of this course is its adaptability to online learning, as it doesn't necessitate access to a physical lab. While most experiments can be conducted by connecting the HaHa board to a computer, a few, like Experiment 9, may require access to a USB Oscilloscope, such as Analog Discovery 2. Instructors can tailor the selection of experiments based on course duration and other considerations.
